[Full release notes](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/releases)

## [v1.4.0 - Jul 17, 2025](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/releases/tag/v1.4.0)

What's New:
- New Cardano connector https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-cardano
    - Powers a reliable event-stream-based API for applications to react to custom Cardano events
    - Own signer module for managing keys 
    - Incorporates it's own Balius wrapper framework for smart contracts
    - Includes in depth documentation section on developing Cardano smart contracts and listening to events
    - Support in FireFly CLI to create a Cardano stack and connect to a remote provider
    - Rust based framework for building FireFly Connectors
- Enhancements to the connector framework to expose internal event listeners to consume directly instead of using external listeners
- Miscellaneous bug fixes and minor improvements 
- Documentation updates, new Cardano section in the tutorials
- CVE fixes across the board

## [v1.3.3 - Mar 25, 2025](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/releases/tag/v1.3.3)

What's New:

- Add new interface for blockchain plugins to stream receipt notifications in transactional batches
    - For blockchain connectors that have an `ack` based reliable receipt stream (or other checkpoint system)
    - Allows strictly ordered delivery of receipts from blockchain plugins that support it
    - Allows resilience on receipt delivery to core, against a checkpoint maintained in the connector
- Changes in metrics:   
    - Added new metrics for Data Exchange for monitoring by a timeseries and alerting system.
        - `ff_multiparty_node_identity_dx_mismatch` notify that the certificate in FireFly Core is different to the one stored in Data Exchange
        - `ff_multiparty_node_identity_dx_expiry_epoch` emit the timestamp of the certificate of Data Exchange useful for SREs to monitor before it expires 
    - Added a namespace label to existing metrics to separate metrics more easily 
    - Added HTTP Response Time and Complete Gauge Support to `firefly-common`
    - Allow the `metrics` server to host additional routes such as status endpoints 
        - This resulted in a new configuration section of `monitoring` to be more appropriate than `metrics` which has now be deprecated. 
- Fix to issue that resulted in retried private messages using local namespace rather than the network namespace
- Fix to issue that could result in messages being marked `Pending` on re-delivery of a batch over the network
- Miscellaneous bug fixes and minor improvements
- Documentation updates, new troubleshooting section for multiparty messages
- CVE fixes and adoption of OpenSSF scorecard on key repositories
    
### Migration consideration

As part of the changes to the metrics to add the new `namespace` label, we changed from using a Prometheus `Counter` to a `CounterVec`. As a result there is no default value of `0` on the counter, which means when users query for a specific metric such as `ff_message_rejected_total` it will not be available until the `CounterVec` associated with that metric is incremented. This has been determined to be an easy upgrade for SRE monitoring these metrics, hence inclusion in a patch release.
