Hyperledger FireFly is an API and data orchestration layer on top of core blockchain technologies.

It implements a [multi-party system](#multi-party-systems) for building enterprise decentralized applications.

- Transaction submission and event streaming
  - Radically simplified API access to your on-chain smart contracts
- Multi-protocol blockchain integration
  - [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric)
  - Enterprise Ethereum - [Hyperledger Besu](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu) & [Quorum](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum)
  - [Corda](https://www.corda.net/) *(work in progress)*
- Developer friendly event-driven REST & WebSocket APIs
  - For building multi-party business applications that solve real enterprise use cases
- Digital assets
  - Tokens and NFTs ready for use, with indexed transaction history, and easy extension/customization
- On-chain/off-chain orchestration
  - Enterprise data flows backed by blockchain, with secure off-chain transfer of private docs+data
  - Pluggable private data exchange / messaging (inc. [HTTPS + Mutual TLS](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-dataexchange-https))
- Identity, data format, and interface distribution
  - Broadcast data schema, proven identity, and on-chain logic integration APIs across the network
  - Pluggable data distribution network with batch optimization (inc. [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/))
  - *Pluggable DIDs for identity and multi-protocol on-chain interface definition are work in progress*
- Microservice architecture, optimized for docker deployment
  - Fully pluggable architecture, embracing multiple runtime technologies (Go, Node.js, Java etc.)
- Built by developers for developers
  - Ready to go in minutes, with a CLI, built-in UI explorer, OpenAPI spec, and samples
- Data operations at the boundary of your data center
  - Fast database cache + audit of all data flowing out of your enterprise, to the network

## Quick Start Guide

Follow the [get started](https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/gettingstarted/gettingstarted.html) guide in the doc, and your
local developer environment will be up in minutes.

You'll have your own private multi-party system, comprising a blockchain (Ethereum/Fabric) with API/Event connectors, a Private Data Exchange, an IPFS data sharing network, and ERC-1155 Token/NFT implementations.

All with the Hyperledger FireFly Explorer UI of course, and a [samples to get you building fast](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-samples).

## API Reference

All the Hyperledger FireFly APIs are self-documenting via Swagger, and you can just open them up on `/api` on your running FireFly.

Or you can check out the [latest API here](https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/swagger/swagger.html).

## Multi-party Systems

Hyperledger Firefly is an implementation of a multi-party system.

![Multi-party System](./images/multi_party_systems.png)

Multi-party systems have the potential to unlock the next wave of digitization in core transaction processing systems. They combine the best features of the existing secure data exchange models for API/WebService/Messaging integration of business data/processes today, with the new technologies of the blockchain revolution.

Working within existing regulatory environments, and existing IT and data security governance frameworks, multi-party systems provide a secure gateway for organizations to participate securely in blockchain backed business ecosystems.

They are the middleware tier for decentralized applications, which are fundamentally different to centralized/SaaS applications because they are hosted independently by each IT organization, and can be customized by each organization to their own IT landscape. These applications communicate through a mix of blockchain, and private data exchange, to execute multi-party transactions at scale - powered by revolutionary new programming constructs like digital assets.

The next wave of business applications that build in a decentralized way on multi-party systems, can orchestrate data and business process flows across organizational boundaries. The integrity of the end-to-end transactions can be established throughout its lifecycle, rather than requiring complex handoff and compensation logic each time a new party performs its step. Yet the autonomy of each business and IT team is maintained in a way that could not be by pooling data and business logic in a 3rd party centralized business application.

Blockchain and other advanced cryptography technologies like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), and trusted execution environments (TEEs), are the core technologies that enable this new model of cross-organizational data flow.

In an enterprise context these raw technologies are necessary, but not sufficient. Organizations need a comprehensive toolset at the boundary of their *existing core systems of record* to govern the flow of data out of their own secure IT infrastructure.
- To store the private data staged in canonical formats ready for exchange with other parties
- For retrieval of the state of transaction and data flows in-flight in the system
- To provide an audit record and reporting system for what has been shared so far
- Providing event-driven integration APIs fit for purpose to integrate to the core systems of record

This all needs to be fast, secure and reliable.

## Event-driven programming model

The core programming model of FireFly is event-driven:
- FireFly delivers data and actions from your application instance, reliably to on-chain logic and privately to other parties in the network
- FireFly receives data and actions from on-chain, and other parties in the network, correlates them, and once complete and verified delivers them to your application for processing

For this reason FireFly has a pluggable database that keeps track of all those interactions.

This database is *not intended to replace* your application database (apart from in early PoC scenarios). Instead it complements it.

You process the events from the network as they happen, **including ones you submit** because they have to be ordered with other events in the network ([learn more](https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/keyconcepts/multiparty_process_flow.html)).

Then you update the indexed business objects in your own database, as a result of the ordered state changes that come from the network. At any point you can go back and retrieve the set of events that caused that update to your "latest" state, whether that's on-chain transaction events, digital asset transfers (Tokens/NFTs), private data transfers, or a combination.

## Hyperledger FireFly project status

A number projects are actively building on Hyperledger FireFly today, and the current feature set and API is sufficient to build many decentralized applications. Some of the microservice components have matured through a number of years (including production adoption), others are new, and some areas are still evolving quickly and subject to flux in the APIs and feature set. 

Overall, the community is working hard towards a V1.0 release.

A good reference for the scope of the V1.0 release is included in issue #117. You might be interested in getting involved.
