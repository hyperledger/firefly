// Pin represents a ledger-pinning event that has been
// detected from the blockchain, in the sequence that it was detected.
//
// A batch contains many messages, and each of those messages can be on a different
// topic (or topics)
// All messages on the same topic must be processed in the order that
// the batch pinning events arrive from the blockchain.
//
// As we need to correlate the on-chain events, with off-chain data that might
// arrive at a different time (or never), we "park" all pinned sequences first,
// then only complete them (and generate the associated events) once all the data
// has been assembled for all messages on that sequence, within that batch.
//
// We might park the pin first (from the blockchain), or park the batch first
// (if it arrived first off-chain).
// There's a third part as well that can block a message, which is large blob data
// moving separately to the batch. If we get the private message, then the batch,
// before receiving the blob data - we have to upgrade a batch-park, to a pin-park.
// This is because the sequence must be in the order the pins arrive.
