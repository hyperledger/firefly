// Plugin is the interface implemented by each data exchange plugin
//
// Data exchange plugins are responsible for qualities of service for:
// - Storage of large data payloads
// - Security of transfer of data between participants (transport and payload authorization & encryption)
// - Reliability of transfer of data between participants (many transports can be supported - HTTPs/AMQP/MQTT etc.)
//
// Each plugin must handle network addressing, as well as transfer of messages and BLOBs.
//
// Network addressing:
// - Each node must have a "peerID" (<=256b) that uniquely identifies a node within the data exchange network
// - A node must provide a JSON package of data for connectivity to a node, which FireFly can distribute to all other nodes to address this node
//
// Messages:
// - Are provided in-line in requests to transfer to a peer
// - Must drive events on the target node that contain the input data
// - No requirement to retain the data beyond the confirmation of receipt of the event at the target
//
// BLOBS
// - Can be stored and retrieved separately from their transfer
// - Transfers are initiated via reference (not in-line data)
// - Are hashed by the DX plugin using the same hashing algorithm as FireFly (SHA256)
// - DX plugins can mainain their own internal IDs for BLOBs within the following requirements:
//   - Given a namespace and ID, map to a "payloadRef" string (<1024chars) that allows that same payload to be retrieved using only that payloadRef
//     - Example would be a logical filesystem path like "local/namespace/ID"
//   - When data is recevied from other members in the network, be able to return the hash when provided with the remote peerID string, namespace and ID
//     - Could be done by having a data store to resolve the transfers, or simply a deterministic path to metadata like "receive/peerID/namespace/ID"
//   - Events triggered for arrival of blobs must contain the payloadRef, and the hash
//
