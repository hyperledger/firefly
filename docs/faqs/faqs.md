=======
## ðŸ“œ How do I deploy smart contracts?
FireFly natively supports the ability to mint, burn, and transfer ERC1155 tokens. If you'd like to deploy ERC20 or ERC721 contracts you can follow the steps outlined in this [Github Issue](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-tokens-erc20-erc721/issues/39#issuecomment-1084690452) and transact with them on FireFly

## ðŸ¦Š Can I connect FireFly to MetaMask?
Yes! In order to do this, you'll want to set up a FireFly stack with ERC20 or ERC721 and deploy an ERC20 or ERC721 contract to the chain. Once this is done, you can set up a new network in MetaMask using the deployed contract address and transfer tokens between MetaMask wallets.
