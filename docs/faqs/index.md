# FAQs

Find answers to the most commonly asked FireFly questions.

## How does FireFly enable multi-chain applications?

It's best to think about FireFly as a rich orchestration layer that sits one layer above the blockchain. FireFly helps to abstract away much of the complex blockchain functionality (such as data exchange, private messaging, common token functionality, etc) in a loosely coupled microservice architecture with highly pluggable components. This enables application developers to focus on building innovative Web3 applications.

There aren't any out of the box bridges to connect two separate chains together, but with a collection of FireFly instances across a consortium, FireFly could help listen for events on Blockchain A and take an action on Blockchain B when certain conditions are met.

## ðŸ“œ How do I deploy smart contracts?

The recommended way to deploy smart contracts on Ethereum chains is by using FireFly's built in API. For a step by step example of how to do this you can refer to the [Smart Contract Tutorial](../tutorials/custom_contracts/ethereum.md#contract-deployment) for Ethereum based chains.

For Fabric networks, please refer to the [Fabric chaincode lifecycle docs](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode_lifecycle.html) for detailed instructions on how to deploy and manage Fabric chaincode.

## ðŸ¦Š Can I connect FireFly to MetaMask?

Yes! Before you set up MetaMask you'll likely want to create some tokens that you can use to send between wallets on your FF network. Go to the tokens tab in your FireFly node's UI, create a token pool, and then mint some tokens. Once you've done this, follow the steps listed [here](https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/tutorials/tokens/erc721.html#use-metamask) to set up MetaMask on your network.
