Operations are stateful external actions that FireFly triggers via plugins. They can succeed or fail.
They are grouped into Transactions in order to accomplish a single logical task.

The diagram below shows the different types of operation that are performed by each
FireFly plugin type. The color coding (and numbers) map those different types of operation
to the [Transaction](./transaction.html) types that include those operations.
