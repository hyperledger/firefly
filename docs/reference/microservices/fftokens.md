## Overview

fftokens is an API specification that can be implemented by token connector runtimes in order to be usable by the [fftokens](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/blob/main/internal/tokens/fftokens/fftokens.go) plugin in FireFly.

The connector runtime must expose an **HTTP and websocket server**, along with a minimum set of REST APIs and websocket events. Each connector will be strongly coupled to a specific ledger technology and token standard(s), but **no assumptions are made** in the fftokens spec about what these technologies must be, as long as they can satisfy the basic requirements laid out here.

Note that this is an _internal_ protocol in the FireFly ecosystem - application developers working against FireFly should never need to care about or directly
interact with a token connector runtime. The audience for this document is only developers interested in creating new token connectors (or editing/forking
existing ones).

Two implementations of this specification have been created to date (both based on common Ethereum token standards) - [firefly-tokens-erc1155](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-tokens-erc1155) and [firefly-tokens-erc20-erc721](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-tokens-erc20-erc721).

## REST APIs

This is the minimum set of APIs that must be implemented by a conforming token connector. A connector may choose to expose other APIs for its own purposes. All requests and responses to the APIs below are encoded as JSON. The APIs are currently understood to live under a `/api/v1` prefix.

### `POST /createpool`

Create a new token pool. The exact meaning of this is flexible - it may mean invoking a contract or contract factory to actually define a new set of tokens via a blockchain transaction, or it may mean indexing a set of tokens that already exists (depending on the options a connector accepts in `config`).

In a multiparty network, this operation will only be performed by one of the parties, and FireFly will broadcast the result to the others.

FireFly will store a "pending" token pool after a successful creation, but will replace it with a "confirmed" token pool after a successful activation (see below).

**Request**
```
{
  "type": "fungible",
  "signer": "0x0Ef1D0Dd56a8FB1226C0EaC374000B81D6c8304A",
  "name": "FFCoin",
  "symbol": "FFC",
  "data": "pool-metadata",
  "requestId": "1",
  "config": {}
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| type | string enum | The type of pool to create. Currently supported types are "fungible" and "nonfungible". It is recommended (but not required) that token connectors support both. Unrecognized/unsupported types should be rejected with HTTP 400. |
| signer | string | The signing identity to be used for the blockchain transaction, in a format understood by this connector. |
| name | string | (OPTIONAL) If supported by this token contract, this is a requested name for the token pool. May be ignored at the connector's discretion. |
| symbol | string | (OPTIONAL) If supported by this token contract, this is a requested symbol for the token pool. May be ignored at the connector's discretion. |
| requestId | string | (OPTIONAL) A unique identifier for this request. Will be included in the "receipt" websocket event to match receipts to requests. |
| data | string | (OPTIONAL) A data string that should be returned in the connector's response to this creation request. |
| config | object | (OPTIONAL) An arbitrary JSON object where the connector may accept additional parameters if desired. Each connector may define its own valid options to influence how the token pool is created. |

**Response**

HTTP 200: pool creation was successful, and the pool details are returned in the response.

_See [Response Types: Token Pool](#token-pool-1)_

HTTP 202: request was accepted, but pool will be created asynchronously, with "receipt" and "token-pool" events sent later on the websocket.

_See [Response Types: Async Request](#async-request)_

### `POST /activatepool`

Activate a token pool to begin receiving events. Generally this means the connector will create blockchain event subscriptions to transfer and approval events related to the set of tokens encompassed by this token pool.

In a multiparty network, this step will be performed by every member after a successful token pool broadcast. It therefore also serves the purpose of validating the broadcast info - if the connector does not find a valid pool given the `poolLocator` and `config` information passed in to this call, the pool should not get confirmed.

**Request**
```
{
  "poolLocator": "id=F1",
  "poolData": "extra-pool-info",
  "requestId": "1",
  "config": {}
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| poolLocator | string | The locator of the pool, as supplied by the output of the pool creation. |
| poolData | string | (OPTIONAL) A data string that should be permanently attached to this pool and returned in all events. |
| requestId | string | (OPTIONAL) A unique identifier for this request. Will be included in the "receipt" websocket event to match receipts to requests. |
| config | object | (OPTIONAL) An arbitrary JSON object where the connector may accept additional parameters if desired. This should be the same `config` object that was passed when the pool was created. |

**Response**

HTTP 200: pool activation was successful, and the pool details are returned in the response.

_See [Response Types: Token Pool](#token-pool-1)_

HTTP 202: request was accepted, but pool will be activated asynchronously, with "receipt" and "token-pool" events sent later on the websocket.

_See [Response Types: Async Request](#async-request)_

HTTP 204: activation was successful - no separate receipt will be delivered, but "token-pool" event will be sent later on the websocket.

_No body_

## Websocket Events

All websocket events are a JSON string of the form:
```
{
  "id": "event-id",
  "event": "event-name",
  "data": {}
}
```

The `event` name will match one of the names listed below, and the `data` payload will correspond to the linked response object.

All events _except the receipt event_ must be acknowledged by sending an ack of the form:
```
{
  "event": "ack",
  "data": {
    "id": "event-id"
  }
}
```

Many messages may also be batched into a single websocket event of the form:
```
{
  "id": "event-id",
  "event": "batch",
  "data": {
    "events": [
      {
        "event": "event-name",
        "data": {}
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

Batched messages must be acked all at once using the ID of the batch.

### `receipt`

An asynchronous operation has completed.

_See [Response Types: Receipt](#receipt-1)_

### `token-pool`

A new token pool has been created or activated.

_See [Response Types: Token Pool](#token-pool-1)_

### `token-mint`

Tokens have been minted.

_See [Response Types: Token Transfer](#token-transfer-1)_

### `token-burn`

Tokens have been burned.

_See [Response Types: Token Transfer](#token-transfer-1)_

### `token-transfer`

Tokens have been transferred.

_See [Response Types: Token Transfer](#token-transfer-1)_

### `token-approval`

Token approvals have changed.

_See [Response Types: Token Approval](#token-approval-1)_

## Response Types

### Async Request

Many operations may happen asynchronously in the background, and will return only a request ID. This may be a request ID that was passed in, or if none was passed, will be randomly assigned. This ID can be used to correlate with a receipt event later received on the websocket.

```
{
  "id": "b84ab27d-0d50-42a6-9c26-2fda5eb901ba"
}
```

### Receipt

```
  "headers": {
    "type": "",
    "requestId": ""
  }
  "transactionHash": "",
  "errorMessage": ""
