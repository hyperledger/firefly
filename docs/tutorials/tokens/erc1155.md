## Previous steps: Install the FireFly CLI
If you haven't set up the FireFly CLI already, please go back to the Getting Started guide and read the section on how to [Install the FireFly CLI](../../gettingstarted/firefly_cli.md).

[← ① Install the FireFly CLI](../../gettingstarted/firefly_cli.md){: .btn .btn-purple .mb-5}

## Create a stack with an ERC-1155 connector
The default token connector that the FireFly CLI sets up is for ERC-20 and ERC-721. If you would like to work with ERC-1155 tokens, you need to create a stack that is configured to use that token connector. To do that, run:
```
ff init ethereum -t erc-1155
```

Then run:
```
ff start <your_stack_name>
```

## About the sample token contract
When the FireFly CLI set up your FireFly stack, it also deployed a sample ERC-1155 contract that conforms to the expectations of the token connector. When you create a token pool through FireFly's token APIs, that contract will be used by default.

<div style="color: #ffffff; background: #ff7700; padding: 1em; border-radius: 5px;">⚠️ <span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING</span>: The default token contract that was deployed by the FireFly CLI is only provided for the purpose of learning about FireFly. It is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> a production grade contract. If you intend to deploy a production application using tokens on FireFly, you should research token contract best practices. For details, <a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-tokens-erc1155/blob/main/samples/solidity/contracts/ERC1155MixedFungible.sol">please see the source code</a> for the contract that was deployed.</div>

## Use the Sandbox (optional)
At this point you could open the Sandbox at [http://127.0.0.1:5109/home?action=tokens.pools](http://127.0.0.1:5109/home?action=tokens.pools) and perform the functions outlined in the rest of this guide. Or you can keep reading to learn how to build HTTP requests to work with tokens in FireFly.

## Create a pool (using default token contract)
After your stack is up and running, the first thing you need to do is create a token pool. Every application will need at least one token pool. At a minimum, you must always specify a `name` and `type` (`fungible` or `nonfungible`) for the pool.

`POST` `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/namespaces/default/tokens/pools`

```json
{
  "name": "testpool",
  "type": "fungible"
}
```

Other parameters:
- You must specify a `connector` if you have configured multiple token connectors
- You may pass through a `config` object of additional parameters, if supported by your token connector
- You may specify a `key` understood by the connector (i.e. an Ethereum address) if you'd like to use a non-default signing identity

## Create a pool (from a deployed token contract)
If you wish to use a contract that is already on the chain, it is recommended that you first upload the ABI for your specific contract by [creating a FireFly contract interface](../custom_contracts/ethereum.md). This step is optional if you're certain that your ERC-1155 ABI conforms to the default expectations of the token connector, but is generally recommended.

See the [README](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-tokens-erc1155/blob/main/README.md) of the token connector for details on what contract variants can currently be understood.

You can pass a `config` object with an `address` when you make the request to create the token pool, and if you created a contract interface, you can include the `interface` ID as well.

`POST` `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/namespaces/default/tokens/pools`

```json
{
  "name": "testpool",
  "type": "fungible",
  "interface": {
    "id": "b9e5e1ce-97bb-4a35-a25c-52c7c3f523d8"
  },
  "config": {
    "address": "0xb1C845D32966c79E23f733742Ed7fCe4B41901FC"
  }
}
```

## Mint tokens

Once you have a token pool, you can mint tokens within it. With the default sample contract,
only the creator of a pool is allowed to mint - but each contract may define its own permission model.

`POST` `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/namespaces/default/tokens/mint`

```json
{
  "amount": 10
}
```

Other parameters:
- You must specify a `pool` name if you've created more than one pool
- You may specify a `key` understood by the connector (i.e. an Ethereum address) if you'd like to use a non-default signing identity
- You may specify `to` if you'd like to send the minted tokens to a specific identity (default is the same as `key`)

## Transfer tokens

You may transfer tokens within a pool by specifying an amount and a destination understood by the connector (i.e. an Ethereum address).
With the default sample contract, only the owner of a token or another approved account may transfer it away - but each contract may define its
own permission model.

`POST` `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/namespaces/default/tokens/transfers`

```json
{
  "amount": 1,
  "to": "0x07eab7731db665caf02bc92c286f51dea81f923f"
}
```

> **NOTE:** When transferring a non-fungible token, the amount must always be `1`. The `tokenIndex` field is also required when transferring a non-fungible token.

Other parameters:
- You must specify a `pool` name if you've created more than one pool
- You may specify a `key` understood by the connector (i.e. an Ethereum address) if you'd like to use a non-default signing identity
- You may specify `from` if you'd like to send tokens from a specific identity (default is the same as `key`)

## Sending data with a transfer

All transfers (as well as mint/burn operations) support an optional `message` parameter that contains a broadcast or private
message to be sent along with the transfer. This message follows the same convention as other FireFly messages, and may be comprised
of text or blob data, and can provide context, metadata, or other supporting information about the transfer. The message will be
batched, hashed, and pinned to the primary blockchain.

The message ID and hash will also be sent to the token connector as part of the transfer operation, to be written to the token blockchain
when the transaction is submitted. All recipients of the message will then be able to correlate the message with the token transfer.

`POST` `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/namespaces/default/tokens/transfers`

### Broadcast message
```json
{
  "amount": 1,
  "to": "0x07eab7731db665caf02bc92c286f51dea81f923f",
  "message": {
    "data": [{
      "value": "payment for goods"
    }]
  }
}
```

### Private message
```json
{
  "amount": 1,
  "to": "0x07eab7731db665caf02bc92c286f51dea81f923f",
  "message": {
    "header": {
      "type": "transfer_private",
    },
    "group": {
      "members": [{
          "identity": "org_1"
      }]
    },
    "data": [{
      "value": "payment for goods"
    }]
  }
}
```

Note that all parties in the network will be able to see the transfer (including the message ID and hash), but only
the recipients of the message will be able to view the actual message data.

## Burn tokens

You may burn tokens by simply specifying an amount. With the default sample contract, only the owner of a token or another approved account may
burn it - but each connector may define its own permission model.

`POST` `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/namespaces/default/tokens/burn`

```json
{
  "amount": 1,
}
```

> **NOTE:** When burning a non-fungible token, the amount must always be `1`. The `tokenIndex` field is also required when burning a non-fungible token.

Other parameters:
- You must specify a `pool` name if you've created more than one pool
- You may specify a `key` understood by the connector (i.e. an Ethereum address) if you'd like to use a non-default signing identity
- You may specify `from` if you'd like to burn tokens from a specific identity (default is the same as `key`)

## Token approvals
You can also approve other wallets to transfer tokens on your behalf with the `/approvals` API. The important fields in a token approval API request are as follows:

- `approved`: Sets whether another account is allowed to transfer tokens out of this wallet or not. If not specified, will default to `true`. Setting to `false` can revoke an existing approval.
- `operator`: The other account that is allowed to transfer tokens out of the wallet specified in the `key` field
- `key`: The wallet address for the approval. If not set, it defaults to the address of the FireFly node submitting the transaction

Here is an example request that would let the signing account `0x634ee8c7d0894d086c7af1fc8514736aed251528` transfer any amount of tokens from my wallet
