## Quick reference

- Sends a `message` visible to all parties in the network
  - The message describes who sent it, and exactly what data was sent
- A `message` has one or more attached pieces of business `data`
  - Can be sent in-line, uploaded in advanced, or received from other parties
  - Can include smaller JSON payloads suitable for database storage
    - These can be verified against a `datatype`
  - Can include references to large (multi megabyte/gigabyte) Blob data
- Sequenced via the blockchain
  - The blockchain does not contain any data, just a hash pin
- Batched for efficiency
  - One `batch` can pin hundreds of `message` broadcasts
  - The whole batch is written to the shared storage

## Example 1: Inline string data

`POST` `/api/v1/namespaces/default/broadcast/message`

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "value": "a string"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example message response

Status: `202 Accepted` - the message is on it's way, but has not yet been confirmed.

> _Issue [#112](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/issues/112) proposes adding
> an option to wait for the message to be confirmed by the blockchain before returning,
> with `200 OK`._

```json
{
  "header": {
    "id": "607e22ad-04fa-434a-a073-54f528ca14fb", // uniquely identifies this broadcast message
    "type": "broadcast", // set automatically
    "txtype": "batch_pin", // message will be batched, and sequenced via the blockchain
    "author": "0x0a65365587a65ce44938eab5a765fe8bc6532bdf", // set automatically in this example to the node org
    "created": "2021-07-01T18:06:24.5817016Z", // set automatically
    "namespace": "default", // the 'default' namespace was set in the URL
    "topics": [
      "default" // the default topic that the message is published on, if no topic is set
    ],
    // datahash is calculated from the data array below
    "datahash": "5a7bbc074441fa3231d9c8fc942d68ef9b9b646dd234bb48c57826dc723b26fd"
  },
  "hash": "81acf8c8f7982dbc49258535561461601cbe769752fecec0f8ce0358664979e6", // hash of the header
  "state": "ready", // this message is stored locally but not yet confirmed
  "data": [
    // one item of data was stored
    {
      "id": "8d8635e2-7c90-4963-99cc-794c98a68b1d", // can be used to query the data in the future
      "hash": "c95d6352f524a770a787c16509237baf7eb59967699fb9a6d825270e7ec0eacf" // sha256 hash of `"a string"`
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example 2: Inline object data to a topic (no datatype verification)

It is very good practice to set a `tag` and `topic` in each of your messages:

- `tag` should tell the apps receiving the broadcast (including the local app), what
  to do when it receives the message. Its the reason for the broadcast - an
  application specific type for the message.
- `topic` should be something like a well known identifier that relates to the
  information you are publishing. It is used as an ordering context, so all
  broadcasts on a given topic are assured to be processed in order.

`POST` `/api/v1/namespaces/default/broadcast/message`

```json
{
  "header": {
    "tag": "new_widget_created",
    "topics": ["widget_id_12345"]
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "value": {
        "id": "widget_id_12345",
        "name": "superwidget"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example 3: Upload a blob with metadata and broadcast

Here we make two API calls.

1. Create the `data` object explicitly, using a multi-party form upload

- You can also just post JSON to this endpoint

2. Broadcast a message referring to that data

- The Blob attachment gets published to shared storage
  - This happens the first time a broadcast happens on a data attachment
- A pin goes to the blockchain
- The metadata goes into a batch with the message

### Multipart form post of a file

Example curl command (Linux/Mac) to grab an image from the internet,
and pipe it into a multi-part form post to FireFly.

> _Note we use `autometa` to cause FireFly to automatically add
> the `filename`, and `size`, to the JSON part of the `data` object for us._

```sh
curl -sLo - https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/raw/main/docs/firefly_logo.png \
 | curl --form autometa=true --form file=@- \
   http://localhost:5000/api/v1/namespaces/default/data
```

### Example data response from Blob upload

Status: `200 OK` - your data is uploaded to your local FireFly node

At this point the data has not be shared with anyone else in the network

```json
{
  // A uniquely generated ID, we can refer to when sending this data to other parties
  "id": "97eb750f-0d0b-4c1d-9e37-1e92d1a22bb8",
  "validator": "json", // the "value" part is JSON
  "namespace": "default", // from the URL
  // The hash is a combination of the hash of the "value" metadata, and the
  // hash of the blob
  "hash": "997af6a9a19f06cc8a46872617b8bf974b106f744b2e407e94cc6959aa8cf0b8",
  "created": "2021-07-01T20:20:35.5462306Z",
  "value": {
    "filename": "-", // dash is how curl represents the filename for stdin
    "size": 31185 // the size of the blob data
  },
  "blob": {
    // A hash reference to the blob
    "hash": "86e6b39b04b605dd1b03f70932976775962509d29ae1ad2628e684faabe48136"
    // Note at this point there is no public reference. The only place
    // this data has been uploaded to is our own private data exchange.
    // It's ready to be published to everyone (broadcast), or privately
    // transferred (send) to other parties in the network. But that hasn't
    // happened yet.
  }
}
```

### Broadcast the uploaded data

Just include a reference to the `id` returned from the upload.

`POST` `/api/v1/namespaces/default/broadcast/message`

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "97eb750f-0d0b-4c1d-9e37-1e92d1a22bb8"
    }
  ]
}
```
