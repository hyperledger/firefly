## Pluggable Microservices Architecture

The ability for every component to be pluggable is at the core of Hyperledger FireFly.

A microservices approach is used, combining code plug-points in the core runtime, with API extensibility
to remote runtimes implemented in a variety of programming languages.

## Extension points

- Blockchain - a rich framework for extensibility to any blockchain / digital ledger technology (DLT)
- Tokens - mapping token standards and governance models to a common data model
- Shared storage - supporting permissioned and public distributed storage technologies
- Data exchange - private local/storage and encrypted transfer of data
- Identity - flexibility for resolving identities via Decentralized IDentifier (DID)
- Persistence - the local private database

## Blockchain Connector Framework

The most advanced extension point is for the blockchain layer, where multiple layers of extensibility
are provided to support the programming models, and behaviors of different blockchain technologies.

This framework has been proven with technologies as different as EVM based Layer 2 Ethereum Scaling
solutions like Polygon, all the way to permissioned Hyperledger Fabric networks.
