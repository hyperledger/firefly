There are two modes of usage for Hyperledger Firefly: **Web3 Gateway** and **Multiparty**

> A single runtime can operate in both of these modes, using different [namespaces](../reference/namespaces.md).

## Web3 Gateway Mode

![Gateway Mode](../images/gateway_mode.png)

Web3 Gateway mode lets you interact with any Web3 application, regardless of whether Hyperledger FireFly
is being used by other members of your business network.

In this mode you can:
- Transfer tokenized value
- Invoke any other type of smart contract
- Index data from the blockchain
- Reliably trigger events in your applications and back-office core systems
- Manage decentralized data (NFTs etc.)
- Use a _private_ address book to manage signing identities and relationships
- ... and much more

Learn more about [Web3 Gateway Mode](./gateway_features.html).

## Multiparty Mode

Multiparty mode is used to build multi-party systems, with a common application runtime deployed by each enterprise participant.

This allows sophisticated applications to be built, that all use the pluggable APIs of Hyperledger FireFly to achieve
end-to-end business value in an enterprise context.

In this mode you can do everything you could do in Web3 Gateway mode, plus:
- Share and enforce common data formats
- Exchange data privately, via an encrypted data bus
  - Structured JSON data payloads
  - Large documents
- Coordinate on-chain and off-chain data exchange
  - Private data
  - Broadcast data
- Mask on-chain activities using hashes
- Use a _shared_ address book to manage signing identities and relationships
- ... and much more
