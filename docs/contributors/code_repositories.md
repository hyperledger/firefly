FireFly has a plugin based architecture design, with a microservice runtime footprint.
As such there are a number of repos, and the list will grow as the community evolves.

But not to worry, one of those repos is a CLI designed to get you running with all the components you need in minutes!

- [CLI / Developer experience](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-cli)
- [FireFly Samples](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-samples)
- [UI Explorer](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-ui)
- [Core](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly)
- [HTTP Data Exchange](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-dataexchange-https)
- [Ethereum (Hyperledger Besu / Quorum) connector](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-ethconnect)
- [Corda connector](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-cordaconnect)
- [Hyperledger Fabric connector](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-fabconnect)
- [Token connector reference implementation (ERC1155)](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-tokens-erc1155)

> Note only the projects that are primarily built to support FireFly are listed here, not all
> of the ecosystem of projects that integrate underneath the plugins.
