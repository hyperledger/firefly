## FireFly CLI

The FireFly CLI can be used to create local FireFly stacks for offline development of blockchain apps. This allows developers to rapidly iterate on their idea without needing to set up a bunch of infrastructure before they can write the first line of code.

## Prerequisites

In order to run the FireFly CLI, you will need a few things installed on your dev machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- openssl

### Linux Users
> **NOTE**: For Linux users, it is recommended that you add your user to the `docker` group so that you do not have to run `ff` or `docker` as `root` or with `sudo`. For more information about Docker permissions on Linux, please see [Docker's documentation on the topic](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

### Windows Users
 > **NOTE**: For Windows users, we recommend that you use [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/). Binaries provided for Linux will work in this environment.

## Install the CLI

There are several ways to install the FireFly CLI. The easiest way to get up and running with the FireFly CLI is to download a pre-compiled binary of the latest release.

### Download the package for your OS
Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-cli/releases/latest) and download the package for your OS and CPU architecture.

### Extract the binary and move it to `/usr/bin/local`

Assuming you downloaded the package from GitHub into your `Downloads` directory, run the following command:

```
sudo tar -zxf ~/Downloads/firefly-cli_*.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin ff && rm ~/Downloads/firefly-cli_*.tar.gz
```

If you downloaded the package from GitHub into a different directory, you will need to change the `tar` command above to wherever the `firefly-cli_*.tar.gz ` file is located.

### macOSUsers
 > **NOTE**: On recent versions of macOS, default security settings will prevent the FireFly CLI binary from running, because it was downloaded from the internet. You will need to [allow the FireFly CLI in System Preferences](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-cli/blob/main/docs/mac_help.md), before it will run.


### Alternative installation method: Install via Go

If you have a local Go development environment, and you have included `${GOPATH}/bin` in your path, you could also use Go to install the FireFly CLI by running:

```sh
go install github.com/hyperledger/firefly-cli/ff@latest
```

## Verify the installation

After using either installation method above, you can verify that the CLI is successfully installed by running `ff version`. This should print the current version like this:
```
{
  "Version": "v0.0.47",
  "License": "Apache-2.0"
}
```

## Next steps: Start your environment
Now that you've got the FireFly CLI set up on your machine, the next step is to create and start a FireFly stack.
